                <h1>The science of setting & achieving goals</h1>
                <h2>Learn by making mistakes & how hard should you be setting your goals</h2> 
                <p>Making error is key to neuroplasticity. This may seem counter-intuitive, but the scientific literature have shown that <mark>whenever we're trying to learn something new, if we make an error, we feel frustrated, but that frustration cues up particular brain areas to be more alert, so that on subsequent attempts to learn that thing, we have a heightened level of focus, and a higher probability of learning the new skill, regardless of what that skill is</mark>. This means that people should be encouraged to embrace errors or pursue errors, not as the end goals but as entry points for making the brain more plastic. And if you think about it, it makes sense: Why would the brain change itself if it's performing perfectly?.</p>
                <p>However, what should the rate of errors be? In other words, how hard should the given task you're trying to learn or perform be? We know for a fact that it is really discouraging to always fail. Well it turns out that there is an answer in a recent paper: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12552-4">"The Eighty Five Percent Rule for optimal learning"</a> published in the journal Nature Communications. This paper basically shows that when learning something new, you want to make the difficulty of what you're trying to learn such that you're getting things right 85% of the time. There's no protocol to make errors exactly 15% of the time, be it math, language, or sports, but <mark>you shouldn't be failing every attempt, or even half of all attempts, and you shouldn't be doing everything well all the time either.</mark>. This knowledge has applications for both teachers and students.</p>
                <h2>Visualizing goals is only helpful at the start</h2>
                <h2>Visualizing failure is the best ongoing motivator</h2>
                <p>The scientific literature shows that there's a near doubling in the probability of achieving one's goals if you routinely focus on foreshadowing failure.</p>
                <p>For example, somebody sets the goal of running five miles four times a week, minimum, and seven times a week, maximum, before 8AM. Thinking about how great you're gonna look & feel only helps at the start. In the long run, it's more effective to think about the negative consequences if you don't run.</p>
                <p>And the same goes with avoiding addiction relapse. There is a technique called "playing the tape backwards" where one thinks about negative outcomes and how things would spiral with this one small action.</p>
