            <p class="description">I know what you're thinking. I'm just an ambitious high school student who aspires to be a doctor and is telling the world how great her time shadowing at the hospital was. If you think so, then you couldn't be more wrong. I was actually on the other end: I was a patient treating my scoliosis (aka abnormal curvature of the spine). A rare experience, right? Without further ado, here are six lessons I drew from this period of my life.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Lesson 1</h2>
            <p>Kids, take good care of your health while you're still young and full of life. It was humiliating seeing my classmates joining extracurricular activities and competing in Science Olympiads while I had to leave this vibrant campus life to go to a hospital. And not just a regular hospital, it was a hospital specializing in rehabilitation, so there were a lot of elderly people (recovering from strokes and diseases of the like). It felt like I had reached retirement age before I truly had the time of my life or left my mark on the world. It's an experience I wouldn't wish on anyone. So again, be grateful for the health you're having now.</p>

            <h2>Lesson 2</h2>
            <p>The first point brings me to the second point which is how unsustainable my method of achieving success was. A little bit of a backstory is that before this experience, I was a pretty good student. I competed in (and got prizes) in both Biology and English Olympiads. I got into multiple elite high schools in my city. But how I achieved that was brutal. I self-isolated myself from my middle school class in part because socializing couldn't help me master academic subjects. What's worse, I didn't exercise at all because I thought it was a waste of time. This will manifest itself in weak and unbalanced muscles that contributed to my scoliosis later on. I was severely sleep-deprived and as a result, my mental health was bad and I frequently caught colds. And, in hindsight unsurprisingly, I couldn’t go on like that for long. I failed miserably in an important test, lost my zeal for learning before I achieved anything significant. The bottom line is that I need to be able to manage my time better and make time for other aspects of life, not just for the sake of my wellbeing but also for my career.</p>

            <h2>Lesson 3</h2>
            <p>Posture is really important. And yes, this epiphany happened before the “Gen Z’s back pain” memes. I tried to convince a friend of this, but I don't think I was very successful. I was ahead of my time you see :)). OK, but seriously though, the condition affected me in many ways, but I didn't take notice: my legs would hurt more than my family members' on the same trip, I had trouble balancing myself, especially on stairs, I occasionally got out of breath at the end of the sentence, I didn't have enough strengths to let my voice be heard, my shoulders would hurt horribly, especially near exam time. And scoliosis, as well as my hunchback posture, didn't appear out of nowhere. Firstly, the laptop is not tall enough for me so I had to look down instead of straight. Ironically, I had already watched a <a href="vid-scoliosis.html">video on how one should position their workspaces to minimize the pain that comes with working for an extended pertiod</a>, but thought that was unnecessary. In addition, I didn't work out regularly, so imbalances in the musculoskeletal system didn't go away naturally like they normally do. So all in all, this is a reminder to adjust or improve your posture.</p>
            <h2>Lesson 4</h2>
            <p>It made me realize there's so much more to life than just work. Prior to this, I thought that the only way to be fulfilled is to do meaningful work. This experience forced me to be grateful for the simple things in life, because well, there isn't much time to do meaningful work given that I was hospitalized. I stopped taking my health for granted and became grateful for the people around me during my rock bottom. I also got a bit more socially competent since I got to watch people from all walks of life interact with each other in the hospital.</p>
            <h2>Lesson 5</h2>
            <p>And I became more grateful for my mom, too. Two months prior, I had a petty argument with my mom, which cost me a place in an Olympiad. Then, she told my teacher a wrong thing about me, so it strained our relationship even further. However, had it not been for my mom, I wouldn't have been able to deal with the administrative hassles at the hospital. She had a lot of experience accompanying me and my sister ==', so she was able to interact with the healthcare staff really well, unlike me who had social anxiety at the time. In short, it made me realize that I've been underestimating my mom's importance in my life and overestimating my ability to be independent. Thanks to this experience, the bond between me and my mom strengthened, and now both of us consulted and confided in each other more.</p>
            <h2>Lesson 6</h2>
            <p>I got to meet a physical therapist, who despite low pay and little recognition (he was a technician, not a doctor), still kept his curiosity about rehabilitation. He was mentoring a few students who majored in Traditional Medicine. He demonstrated how to ask questions and be enthusiastic about learning. Before, I thought only people in ivory towers or students in elite colleges have intellectual curiosity. Turns out, you don't need fancy titles or qualifications to be interested in learning. I particularly admire this guy as I have struggled to stay curious ever since I neglected a few subjects to focus on preparing for the high school entrance exam. The process was so arduous that I no longer found learning exciting. I optimized the amount of learning needed to ace the test rather than searching for extra information. I was too fixated on the result and ignored the intrinsic value of the process. This is something that I'm still working on, to be frank.</p>
