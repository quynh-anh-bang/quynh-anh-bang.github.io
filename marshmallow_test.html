            <h1>Key passages from the book "The marshmallow test: Mastering Self-control" by Walter Mischel</h1>
            <p>These excerpts are what I personally find new & useful. You may learn different lessons from the book so I recommend you check that out.</p>
            <h2>How they do it</h2>
        <p>The power is not in the stimulus, however, but in how it is mentally
            appraised: if you change how you think about it, its impact on what you feel and
            do changes. The tempting chocolate mousse on the restaurant dessert tray loses
            its allure if you imagine a cockroach just snacked on it in the kitchen. Although
            Shakespeare’s Hamlet personified tragically unconstructive ways to appraise
            experience, he made this point insightfully: “There is nothing either good or bad,
            but thinking makes it so.” </p>
        <p>The power resides in the prefrontal cortex, which, if activated, allows almost
            endless ways of cooling hot, tempting stimuli by changing how they are
            appraised. The preschoolers, even with their immature frontal lobes, illustrated
            this with great imagination. <mark>They changed the temptations they faced into “just a
            picture” and put a frame around them in their heads; or shifted their attention
            away from temptations altogether through self-distraction, by inventing songs or
            exploring toes; or transformed them cognitively to focus on their cool and
            informative rather than hot and impulse-arousing features.</mark></p>
        <p>Correlations that are meaningful, consistent, and
            significant statistically can allow broad generalizations for a population—but not
            necessarily confident predictions for an individual. This means that you not being able to delay instant gratification now is correlated to less success in life, but it doesn't mean you're destined to fail. In fact, the study shows that some children start low in delay ability and get
            better at it over the years, and some start out eager and able to delay and then
            show decreasing levels of self-control over time. The experiments at the Bing
            Nursery School demonstrated <mark> how mental representations of temptations can
            change and even reverse their impact on behavior. The child who can’t wait a
            minute can manage to wait for twenty when he changes his thoughts about the
            temptations. </mark></p>
        <p>The experience of short-term stress can be adaptive, mobilizing you into action.
            Stress can become harmful, however, even toxic if it is intense and persists—for
            example, in people who become enraged at every frustration, from traffic jams to
            checkout lines, or who feel overwhelmed under extreme and enduring conditions
            of danger, turbulence, or poverty. Prolonged stress impairs the PFC, which is
            essential not only for waiting for marshmallows but also for things like surviving
            high school, holding down a job, pursuing an advanced degree, navigating office
            politics, avoiding depression, preserving relationships, and refraining from
            decisions that seem intuitively right but on closer examination are really stupid.
            After reviewing research on the effects of stress, neuroscientist Amy Arnsten
            at Yale University concluded that “even quite mild acute uncontrollable stress
            can cause a rapid and dramatic loss of prefrontal cognitive abilities.” The longer
            stress persists, the more those cognitive abilities are hurt and the more
            permanent the damage, ultimately leading to mental as well as physical illness.
            Thus, the part of the brain that enables creative problem solving becomes less
            available the more we need it. Remember Hamlet: as his stress escalated, he
            became increasingly trapped and tortured, paralyzed in his angry ruminations
            and fragmented feelings, and unable to think or act effectively, thus wreaking
            havoc all around him and further accelerating his undoing.

            <h2>The engine of success: "I think I can!"</h2>
            <p><mark>If you believe that persisting on tough tasks is energizing rather than
                depleting, will it protect you from will fatigue? Indeed yes: when people are led
                to think that effortful tasks will invigorate rather than drain them, they improve
                their performance on a later task.</mark> For example, when people were primed to
                believe that they would be energized by controlling their facial expressions (so
                as not to show the emotions they were experiencing), they performed better on
                the later task of squeezing a handgrip. Their later performance was not impaired
                by the earlier effort, and their egos did not deplete.
                At Stanford University, Carol Dweck and her colleagues found that those
                who believed that their stamina fueled itself after tough mental exertion did not
                show diminished self-control after a depleting experience. In contrast, those who
                believed that their energy was depleted after a strenuous experience did show
                diminished self-control and had to rest to refuel.
                Dweck’s team went on to track college students across three points in time,
                the last being their final exam period, which demanded strong self-regulation.
                Students who had an implicit theory of willpower as a non-limited resource fared
                much better during the high-stress exam period than those with a limited resource theory, who reported eating more unhealthy food, procrastinating more,
                and ineffectively regulating while trying to prepare for their tests. These findings
                underscore the importance of how we think about ourselves and our capacities
                for control, and they undermine the idea that our ability to exert effort in pursuit
                of goals is an immutable, biologically driven process.</p>
