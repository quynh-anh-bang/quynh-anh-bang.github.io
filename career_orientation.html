                <h1>Tips on how to identify strengths & choose a career by 80,000 hours- an Oxford-affiliated non-profit</h1>
                <p class="description">You have about 80,000 working hours in your career: 40 years x 50 weeks x 40 hours. If you want to have a positive impact with your life, your choice of career is probably your best opportunity to do that. This is what <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 hours</a>, a non-profit organization affiliated with Oxford, has to say about the topic.</p>
                <h2>‘Match with strengths’ approach seems a little overrated</h2>
                <p>Perhaps the biggest risk is limiting yourself based on your <mark>current</mark> strengths, and ignoring your potential to develop <mark>new, more potent</mark> strengths. This risk is most pressing for younger people, who don’t yet have much data on what they’re good at – making them more likely to guess incorrectly – and have decades ahead of them to develop new strengths.</p>
                <p>It’s often better to take the reverse approach to match with strengths: <mark>ask what the world most needs, then figure out how you might best help with that.</mark></p>
                <p>However, clarifying your strengths is still a useful input into career planning — especially after you’ve had a couple of jobs — and that there are better ways to do it than the norm.</p>
                <h2>Common pitfalls when identifying strengths</h2>
                <h3>1. Look at your absolute level of performance</h3>
                <p>It takes decades to get good at many skills, and there’s no point comparing yourself to someone who has had far more practice.</p>
                <p>Instead, look for times when you performed well <mark>compared to people with similar experiences with yourself</mark>. Roughly, you want to find the skills for which, for a cohort of people with similar experience to yourself, you rank highly among the cohort.</p>
                <p>You would also want to focus more on your <mark>rate of improvement</mark>. Hopefully rate of improvement is a better proxy for long-term success, and seems to be something that often distinguishes people who later become top performers.</p>
                <h3>2. How quickly you learn depends a great deal on the context and teaching</h3>
                <p>Don't be so quick to rule out math as a strength just because you had a bad teacher at school. This is also an area where you can improve: for example, using active recall helps you retain information much more efficiently.</p>
                <h3>3. Not asking for the outside view</h3>
                <p>We often don’t notice our strengths, because what we’re good at feels easy and natural, while our weaknesses create headaches.</p>
                <p>And although people are overconfident in many ways, they tend to underestimate their abilities compared to others for difficult skills.</p>
                <p>This makes it especially useful to ask other people about your strengths. (And in general, I’d suggest <mark>getting more feedback is generally the best route to self-knowledge</mark> – see more on that in the book Insight by Tasha Eurich.)</p>
                <h4>But how to go about it?</h4>
                <p>You might have had performance reviews at work, and so you might already have a lot of feedback to consider. Are there any patterns in that feedback that might suggest a strength?</p>
                <p>If you haven’t had much feedback directly about your strengths in the past — which is not uncommon — then you could consider emailing a couple of friends and past co-workers.</p>
                <p>This can be a bit awkward, but many people enjoy giving positive feedback, and it may well be the quickest and most useful thing you can do to learn about your strengths.</p>
                <p>Here are a couple of questions to consider asking (which are adapted from the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/29aqon8hsuo5gqv/CLG-Genius%20Email%20Campaign.pdf?dl=1">Conscious Leadership Group</a>):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What am I doing or talking about when I seem most energised and happy?</li>
                    <li>When I seem my best, the exact thing I am doing is __________.</li>
                    <li>What are your three favorite qualities you see in me? (Do your best to use one word per quality.)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Capitalising on your strengths > improving your weaknesses</h2>
                <p>With weaknesses, you can:</p> 
                <p>(i) <mark>bring them up to a passable level</mark>,</p>
                <p>(ii) find a path that doesn’t need them,</p> 
                <p>or (iii) <mark>find a team who are strong where you’re weak</mark></p>
