            <h1>What is mindfulness?</h1>
            <p class="description">Have you ever walked into a room to get something, but then forgot what you wanted to get? Or perhaps you've been so caught up with your thoughts that you were late to class, or couldn't follow through on what the other was saying? They are common examples of mindlessness; of not being mindful to the current situation and missing out on the moment. It can cause you to live a distracted life. So, how to address this problem?</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>What is mindfulness, really?</h2>
            <p>At its core, mindfulness means having really well-trained, non-judgmental attention. It means you are paying attention to the moment without being affected by saying whether it is good or bad, sad or happy. This can help you fully engage and participate in your life, hence making a huge difference in your quality of life.</p>

                  <h2>The benefits of mindfulness</h2>
                  <h3>1) Labeling, understanding, and coping</h3>
                  <p>Mindfulness can improve recognition and labeling of emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Thus, it can help highlight WHEN and HOW to use other psychological techniques (such as thought challenging). In fact, mindfulness forms the basis of modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.</p>
                  <h3>2) Reducing judgments</h3>
                  <p>Judgments can fuel negative emotions and decrease the likelihood of effective responses.</p>
                  <h3>3) Joy</h3>
                  <p>Being aware of the beauty of simple things in life helps create opportunities for joy.</p>

                  <h2>The effects of mindlessness</h2>
                  <p>The negatives include feelings of emptiness, an inability to focus among other things.</p>
                  <p>However, expertise research has also revealed that paying too much attention to what you’re doing can have damaging effects, particularly when you perform well-practiced (motor) skills. In fact, this is one reason why some experts appear to “choke under pressure”: they think too much about the mechanics of the task at hand.

            <h2>How to practice mindfulness?</h2>
            <p>Below is a two-minute mindfulness practice.</p>
            <p>First, lie down on your stomach or sit comfortably in a chair. You can put your hand on your belly.</p>
            <p>Turn your attention to your breathing. As you breathe in, feel the cool air flowing into your nostrils and down into your belly. As you breathe out, feel your belly slowly collapsing and the warm air flowing out of your nostrils. Repeat this for about ten times.</p>
