                <h1>The case for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</h1>
                <p class="description">If you question the effectiveness of "talk therapy", then this article is for you.</p>
                <h2>The basis behind Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</h2>
                <p>A theory of personality, championed by Harvard University 
                psychologist B. F. Skinner (1904–1990), is based on the assumption that 
                <mark>many behaviors are learned responses to the environment</mark>. Behaviorism
                rejects the notions of underlying conflicts and the unconscious and focuses 
                instead on observable behaviors and their control by the environment. 
                The probability of a type of behavior increases when it satisfies a craving 
                or produces a pleasurable sensation (positive reinforcement), and it decreases when the consequences are deemed unpleasant or unsatisfactory 
                (negative reinforcement). </p>

                    </figure>
                    
                    <p>According to this theory, <mark>mental disorders may 
                        represent maladaptive behaviors that are learned.</mark> Treatment consists of 
                    active attempts to <mark>“unlearn”</mark> through behavior modification, by:
                    <br>a) introducing new types of behavioral reinforcement
                    <br>and b) by observing and recognizing behavioral responses that are appropriate or inappropriate.</p>
                    <p>Such “psychosocial” approaches to treating mental illness have a sound 
                    neurobiological basis. The brain is structurally modified through learning 
                    and early experience, and these modifications will alter behavioral responses. Treatment relies on psychotherapy, the use of verbal communication to help the patient.</p>
                    <h2>Case study: Me</h2>
                    <p>Last month, I was worried sick about the finals to the point that I couldn't sit down, focus & work. The thought behind this was that: "I'm going to perform poorly & I'm gonna be judged by friends & family". Upon learning about CBT, I recognized that the thought contained two distorted thinking pattern. The first one is predictive thinking: one can never truly know what the future looks like, but here I stated that I was going to fail. I can rewrite this thought as: "I don't know how I will perform in the exam room, but I'm trying my best to prepare for the exam.". The second distorted pattern is mind-reading: one can never truly know what others are thinking. They may judge me, but they also may not notice my results at all.</p>
                    <p>After rewriting my automatic negative thoughts, I was able to control my anxiety to a healthy level that helps me focus more intently on revising. By the way, I eventually got good results.</p>
                    <h2>The shortcomings</h2> 
                    <p>Of course, “talk therapy” is not appropriate for 
                    all mental disorders, any more than a particular antibiotic is appropriate 
                    for all infections. However, until the revolution in biological psychiatry, 
                    variations in psychotherapy were the only tools available to psychiatrists. 
                    Moreover, despite the shift in “blame” away from one’s moral character 
                    and toward early childhood experience, psychotherapy contributed to 
                    the stigmatizing notion that mental illness (in contrast to physical illness) could be overcome by willpower alone. Freud himself recognized the 
                    shortcomings of psychotherapy, stating that the “deficiencies in our [the 
                    psychoanalytic] description would probably vanish if we were already in 
                    a position to replace the psychological terms by physiological or chemical 
                    ones”. Now, nearly a century later, neuroscience has advanced to a point where this goal seems attainable.</p>
